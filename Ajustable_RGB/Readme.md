# Simple way to adjust an RGB led !! 

This project uses 3 Potenciometers (10kohm) to ajuste de color of the RBG Led.

Each one controls the Red, Green and Blue values of the Led and then ajusts the PWM of the digital pins accordingly.

Pretty funny and an interesting way to test the PWM feature of the Arduino!
