# ItÂ´s a Radar! ðŸ”Š

It's a radar equipped with a servo and a buzzer.

It scans for obstacles, and when it detects one, it stops and emits a sound.

If the obstacle is removed, it resumes scanning for obstacles in a continuous cycle.

For a more realist try to place the sensor on top of the servo.
